# iOS-Hak5-Payloads
This repository is a collection of all my Hak5 ducky script payloads written for iOS with a focus on iPhone

Please note that all these payloads come in a disarmed state with timing and certain varibales being filled with a placeholder, this is to prevent any misuse with these payloads, I write all these payloads for security research and with intent to be used for informing and showcasing the O.MG cable 

---PLEASE NOTE---

These payloads require a OTG adapter to be plugged into the device with the O.MG cables active end plugged into the adapter, OTG adapters allow iphones to act as a host and allow input to make these payloads work, 

These payloads were written on on iOS 16.1 - iOS 16.2 timing and actions might be different for different versions of iOS

---FLIPPER INFORMATION--

I will be testing my payloads for use with the FlipperZero badusb feature within the coming days, all my payloads will be available for Hak5 before flipper zero due to all my payloads being written with a new version of ducky script
