# iOS-Hak5-Payloads
This repository is a collection of all my Hak5 ducky script payloads written for iOS with a focus on iPhone

Please note that all these payloads come in a disarmed state with timing and certain varibales being filled with a placeholder, this is to prevent any misuse with these payloads, I write all these payloads for security research and with intent to be used for informing and showcasing the O.MG cable
